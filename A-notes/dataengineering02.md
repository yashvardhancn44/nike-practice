   - Proficiency in programming (Python, Java, SQL), understanding of databases, ETL tools, big data technologies, and cloud platforms.

---

### **2. Data Lifecycle**

4. **What is the data lifecycle?**

   - The data lifecycle includes data collection, storage, processing, and analysis, ensuring data is managed efficiently throughout its journey.

5. **Explain ETL vs ELT.**
   - **ETL**: Extract-Transform-Load; transforms data before loading it into a warehouse.
   - **ELT**: Extract-Load-Transform; data is loaded first into a data lake, then transformed.

### **3. Data Storage**

6. **What is the difference between a data warehouse and a data lake?**

   - **Data Warehouse**: Stores structured data optimized for analytics (e.g., Snowflake).
   - **Data Lake**: Stores raw, unstructured data for flexible processing (e.g., AWS S3).

7. **What is NoSQL, and when should you use it?**

   - NoSQL databases are non-relational databases suited for handling unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB for dynamic schemas).

8. **How do you choose between SQL and NoSQL databases?**
   - Use **SQL** for structured data and complex queries, and **NoSQL** for high scalability and flexibility in data models.

---

### **4. Data Processing**

9. **What is batch processing?**

   - Processing data in large chunks at scheduled intervals (e.g., Apache Hadoop).

10. **What is stream processing?**

    - Real-time processing of data as events occur (e.g., Apache Kafka, Apache Flink).

11. **What is Apache Spark, and why is it popular?**

    - Apache Spark is a distributed data processing framework known for speed, scalability, and support for batch and stream processing.

12. **Explain the role of MapReduce in data engineering.**
    - MapReduce is a programming model for processing large datasets in parallel across distributed clusters (used in Hadoop).

---

### **5. Data Pipelines**

13. **What is a data pipeline?**

    - A system that automates the flow of data from sources to destinations, ensuring data is clean and accessible.

14. **What are the components of a data pipeline?**

    - Data ingestion, transformation, validation, storage, and monitoring.

15. **What is Apache Airflow?**

    - A workflow orchestration tool to schedule and monitor data pipelines.

16. **How do you handle failed jobs in a pipeline?**
    - By implementing retries, logging, and alerting systems to notify errors and ensure fault tolerance.

---

### **6. Data Quality**

17. **How do you ensure data quality in pipelines?**

    - Use validation checks, deduplication, error handling, and monitoring tools.

18. **What is data cleaning?**

    - The process of removing or correcting errors, duplicates, and inconsistencies in raw data.

19. **How do you handle missing data?**
    - Techniques include imputation, removing incomplete records, or using default values.

---

### **7. Scalability and Performance**

20. **What is horizontal and vertical scaling?**

    - **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines to a system.
    - **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing the power (RAM, CPU) of existing machines.

21. **How do you optimize SQL queries for performance?**

    - Use indexing, avoid SELECT \*, partition large tables, and optimize joins.

22. **What is partitioning in databases?**
    - Dividing large tables into smaller, manageable pieces to improve performance.

---

### **8. Big Data**

23. **What is big data?**

    - Large datasets characterized by the 4 V’s: Volume, Velocity, Variety, and Veracity.

24. **What is Hadoop?**

    - An open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets.

25. **What is the role of HDFS in big data?**

    - HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) stores large files across a distributed cluster.

26. **Explain the concept of data sharding.**
    - Data sharding splits a database into smaller parts (shards) to improve scalability and performance.

---

### **9. Cloud and Tools**

27. **What are the benefits of using cloud platforms for data engineering?**

    - Scalability, cost-effectiveness, high availability, and integration with advanced tools.

28. **What are some popular cloud data engineering tools?**

    - AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery, Azure Synapse, Databricks.

29. **What is Snowflake, and how is it used?**
    - Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehouse offering high performance, scalability, and support for structured and semi-structured data.

---

### **10. Security and Governance**

30. **What is data governance?**

    - The practice of managing data access, quality, and policies to ensure compliance and security.

31. **How do you secure sensitive data in pipelines?**

    - Use encryption, access control, masking, and secure transmission protocols.

32. **What is GDPR, and why is it important?**
    - The General Data Protection Regulation is a law governing data privacy in the EU, ensuring proper handling of user data.

---

### **11. Real-World Scenarios**

33. **Describe a time you optimized a data pipeline.**

    - Focus on identifying bottlenecks, tools used, and improvements achieved (e.g., reducing processing time or costs).

34. **How would you design a real-time recommendation system?**
    - Use Kafka for data ingestion, Spark for processing, and a NoSQL database (like Redis) to serve recommendations.
