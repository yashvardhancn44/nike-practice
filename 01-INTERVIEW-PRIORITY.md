# code till 12 pm

- SQL
  - This will mostly be a scenario based mainly using group by, partitions, windows and rank logic
  - It can be scenario based like sales questions having 3 tables how to find out highest or second highest selling product as per category wise along with geo
- Python DSA
  - check logic building ability
- Python topics
- Pyspark

Chatgpt interview:
A 1.5-hour interview for a **Data Engineer** with 1 year of experience typically includes several segments to assess your technical, problem-solving, and communication skills. Here’s a general breakdown:

---

### **1. Introduction (5-10 minutes)**

- **Purpose**: Ice-breaking and understanding your background.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Brief self-introduction.
  - Overview of your current or previous role(s).
  - Discussion of projects you’ve worked on, especially those related to data engineering (e.g., ETL pipelines, data modeling, or working with big data tools).

---

### **2. Technical Assessment (45-60 minutes)**

This is the main focus of the interview, where your technical expertise is evaluated.

#### **a. SQL and Data Manipulation (10-20 minutes)**

- Expect questions requiring you to write complex SQL queries. Example:
  - Joins (inner, outer, etc.).
  - Window functions (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `OVER`).
  - Data aggregation and transformation.
  - Query optimization.

#### **b. Programming (10-15 minutes)**

- Assessment of your coding ability (often in Python or another language relevant to the job).
- Examples:
  - Writing a function to transform or process data.
  - Parsing and cleaning datasets.
  - Basic algorithms or data structures (e.g., arrays, hashmaps, sorting).

#### **c. Data Engineering Tools and Technologies (10-15 minutes)**

- Questions about tools you’ve used (e.g., Apache Kafka, Spark, Airflow, etc.).
- Example topics:
  - Designing and implementing ETL pipelines.
  - Working with databases (SQL/NoSQL).
  - Cloud services for data engineering (AWS, GCP, or Azure).

#### **d. System Design (10-15 minutes)**

- Designing a data pipeline or architecture.
- Example:
  - "Design a data pipeline to process real-time user events and store aggregated results in a database."
  - Questions about handling scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance.

---

### **3. Behavioral Questions (15-20 minutes)**

- Focus on teamwork, problem-solving, and communication.
- Example questions:
  - “Tell me about a time you optimized a data process.”
  - “How do you prioritize tasks when dealing with tight deadlines?”
  - “Describe a challenging bug or issue you encountered and how you resolved it.”

---

### **4. Q&A (5-10 minutes)**

- **Purpose**: To evaluate your interest and give you a chance to ask questions.
- Example questions you can ask:
  - "What does success look like for this role?"
  - "What are some upcoming projects the team is excited about?"
  - "What are the growth opportunities in this role?"

---

### **Tips to Succeed:**

1. **Brush up on SQL:** Be ready to write efficient and optimized queries.
2. **Be confident in your projects:** Highlight any hands-on experience with data pipelines, cloud tools, or large datasets.
3. **Prepare for coding:** Practice Python (or relevant language) with data-related problems.
4. **Review data engineering tools:** Familiarize yourself with ETL processes, data warehousing, and any tools mentioned in the job description.
5. **Focus on communication:** Clearly explain your thought process during problem-solving.

This structure may vary, but the emphasis is usually on your technical expertise and ability to handle data-related challenges.
