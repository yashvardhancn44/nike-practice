# IDE

- VS Code
- PyCharm
- IntelliJ
- Jupiter Notebook

# Basics of Linux commands & shell scripting

- as we will be working a bit on server side -> looking for data size etc.
- server side scriptin
- DO A comprehensive list of Commands, and work on it. (majorly for data engineers)

# DBMS concepts (core knowledge of these databases - for DESIGN INTERVIEWS for design choices)

- working with transactional databases
- ACID properties
- Transactions
- concurrency control
- ER Diagrams
- Indexing
- Data Normalization
- Data Denormalization
- etc -> readmore
- MISC
  - the backbone for entire ecosystem
  - RBBMS vs NoSQL
  - Postres vs MySQL etc

# Databases (read about all types available and why to choose)

### Transactional Databases

- MySql
- Postgres

### NoSQL

- Cassandra
- MongoDB

# SQL (you should be proficient with writing all type of queries -> solving complex queries around these topics)

### All types of Joins

- cross
- inner
- left
- right
- full outer

### where clause, order by clause

### groupby and having

### case when statemnt

### case when statement with group By

### subQueries and Nested SubQueries and Correlated queries

### IN, NOT IN, ANY, ALL, EXISTS, NOT EXIST

### Aggregation and Date Related Functions

### Common Table Expressions

- iterative
- recursive

### window Functions

- over clause, parition by, order by
- count, sum, min, max, avg
- Row_Number, Rank, Dense_Rank
- Lead, Lag
- Nth_value
- Frame Clause
  - Range between
  - rows between

### VIews, Materialized Views, Triggers

### Triggers

### Stored procedures

### Normalization

### optimization

### constraints

### combination of different types of joins on mutliple tables to get the output

### COMBINATION QUESTIONS INVOLVING MULTIPLE TOPICS - MODERATE/MEDIUM-DIFFICULT LEVEL WHICH IS USUALLY ASKED

### COMBINATION QUESTIONS INVOLVING MULTIPLE TOPICS - DIFFICULT LEVEL WHICH IS VERY FREQUENTLY ASKED IN DATA ENGINEER INTERVIEW.

### ETC IMPORTANT TOPICS.
