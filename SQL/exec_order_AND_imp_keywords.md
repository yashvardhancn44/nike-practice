Here’s a **comprehensive execution order table** that includes **CTEs (Common Table Expressions), views, triggers**, and other components often overlooked. This table reflects the **logical execution order** of SQL queries and how these additional features fit in the flow.

| **Step** | **Clause/Feature**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | `WITH` (CTE)             | Common Table Expressions are evaluated first. Temporary result sets are created and can be used in the subsequent query.                        |
| **2**    | `FROM` (including views) | Identifies the source tables, views, or CTEs. For views, the query inside the view is executed here.                                            |
| **3**    | `ON`                     | Filters rows during joins based on specified conditions. Applies to the tables in the `FROM` clause.                                            |
| **4**    | `JOIN`                   | Combines rows from multiple tables using join conditions. Can include `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`, and `CROSS` joins.                      |
| **5**    | `WHERE`                  | Filters rows that do not meet the specified condition(s). Eliminates non-matching rows early to reduce processing load.                         |
| **6**    | `GROUP BY`               | Groups rows with the same value in specified columns. Used for aggregation operations.                                                          |
| **7**    | `HAVING`                 | Filters groups created by `GROUP BY` based on aggregate conditions. Works only with grouped data.                                               |
| **8**    | `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`       | Executes window (analytic) functions such as `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, or `SUM() OVER`. Evaluated after `HAVING` but before `SELECT`.           |
| **9**    | `SELECT`                 | Projects the final columns to include in the output. Can also create derived or calculated columns.                                             |
| **10**   | `DISTINCT`               | Removes duplicate rows from the result set.                                                                                                     |
| **11**   | `ORDER BY`               | Orders the result set based on one or more columns or expressions, in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.                           |
| **12**   | `LIMIT` / `OFFSET`       | Restricts the number of rows returned (`LIMIT`) or skips a specified number of rows (`OFFSET`).                                                 |
| **13**   | `TRIGGERS`               | If an operation like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` modifies the table, triggers fire here. May execute additional SQL or logic automatically. |
| **14**   | `UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT` | Combines the results of multiple queries. `UNION` appends rows, `INTERSECT` finds common rows, and `EXCEPT` removes matching rows.              |
| **15**   | `TEMPORARY TABLES`       | Temporary tables or intermediate results from subqueries may be utilized during this step for complex queries.                                  |
| **16**   | `VIEWS`                  | Queries in views are materialized or executed if referenced in `FROM`. Essentially acts like an inline subquery.                                |
| **17**   | `INDEXES`                | Indexes may be used to optimize row lookups during `WHERE`, `JOIN`, or `ORDER BY`. This is handled by the database engine's optimizer.          |
| **18**   | `TRANSACTIONS`           | Operations wrapped in a transaction (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) are evaluated, ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.  |
| **19**   | `STORED PROCEDURES`      | If the query is part of a stored procedure, the procedure's execution logic and any additional SQL statements are applied here.                 |
| **20**   | `EXPLAIN`                | Used for query planning and performance optimization, not a part of execution but helps visualize how the query would execute.                  |

---

### **Additional Details**:

1. **CTEs**: Always executed before the main query. They simplify complex queries by breaking them into readable steps.
2. **Views**: Inline execution of the query defined in the view happens in the `FROM` clause.
3. **Triggers**: Automatically fired after data modification operations, often inserting, updating, or deleting data.
4. **Indexes**: Not a clause but directly affect execution speed during `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY`.
5. **Transactions**: Ensure that a group of operations either completes entirely or fails as a whole (ACID properties).

This logical order is essential for understanding query optimization and execution. If you'd like examples of any specific feature, let me know!
